## Purpose

"Poof!" is an interactive text-based mystery game, in which the user plays in the first-person perspective of a clueless scientist.

Suddenly waking up during in the aftermath of an experiment-gone-wrong, the scientist (user) is presented with two recipes:
One will create the antidote and one will fail, generating a smokey chemical reaction that will make the scientist forget (restart).

## Features

1. __Choice Points:__ Players interact through choice points, leading to either recipe. Choice points are presented through the use of loops and complex control structures.

2. __Inventory:__ Allows the user to store and interact with ingredients. Implemented through the use of lists and illustrated through the [Prettytable 3.4.1](https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/3.4.1/) package.

3. __Main Menu:__ Introduces the user to the game and presents the option to begin or quit the game. Created with [Simple-term-menu 1.5.1](https://pypi.org/project/simple-term-menu/), ASCII Art and [Colorama 0.4.5](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/).

4. __ASCII Art:__ For visual aesthetics of the game and to allow a more immersive experience to the user.

5. __Coloured Text:__ Allows art, dialogue and inventory to be separated through colours and assists in the visual aesthetics of the game. Using [Colorama 0.4.5](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/).
